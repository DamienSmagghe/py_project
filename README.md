Simulate the internal communication in a neural network.
Provide 4 different models:
- Simplified model
- Weighted Model
- Model under effect of Psychoactive substances
- Model taking into account of the gradual decrease of potential

Each model is an extended version of the previous one.

Recap about the functionality of each model can be find in its description. To understand further about the functionality of a biological neural network and how it is translated into mathematics problems that can be implemented by programming language, please refer to the PDF reseau-neuronal-biologique-theorie.

To play with different models and see how each parameters affect the transmission between neurons in a network, please feel free to run the UI application from NeuralNetwork_main.py

## Tools and technologies used:
- Github
- Python 3.7 (numpy, random, math, matplotlib)
- PyQT5 for create application dialog
